# Vintage Story Modding Co-op Tools Repo
Collection of python tools for making certain VS modding tasks easier. Originally made via the vomit of a markov chain since I don't remember how to write python.<br>
To be improved and maintained by human contributors who are actually competent and have a sense of shame unlike me.

Shitty tools are better than no tools.<br>
— John Tool, inventor of the Bop-It™

## How to use
Either download the script you want and run it yourself, or go to the [releases tab](https://github.com/HugoCortell/VS_Modding_Coop_Tools/releases) and download an executable version of the script.
