# Vintage Story Modding Co-op Tools Repo
Collection of python tools for making certain VS modding tasks easier. Originally made via the vomit of a markov chain since I don't remember how to write python.
To be improved and maintained by human contributors who are actually competent and have a sense of shame unlike me.

Shitty tools are better than no tools.
- John Tool, inventor of the Bop-Itâ„¢
